_This clue is for the birthday girl as she should obviously start the game..._

## Actually....

~~~
Every girl has a parent
Every parent has a name
There are parents who own a car
Some even own a car with a name

What if the car is named after the parent?
Or maybe after the parent's nick-name?
Then the parent should make darn sure
That everyone knows the car's name

If you are here searching for something
You must figure out the name
And once you do figure it out
Your clue is in a plate with that name!
